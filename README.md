# PSPG_245B
drug repositioning workshop

This is a simplified version of the computational drug repositioning pipeline by Bin Chen for use in UCSF PSPG245B. To run this pipeline, download the code directory, download TCGA BRCA data through UCSF Xena, download the CMap data (see Box link) and run workflow.R.
